      <title>A Hartley good jam</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It was the 27th May, the strawberries were ripening on their branches, and the jars were ready. All signs pointing to a fun afternoon of jam-making!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

  
  
      
    
      
    
  
  
  
   
  
   

   
  
 	&lt;p class=&#34;pullquote pullquote-right&#34; data-pullquote=&#34;&amp;#34;I think I know what&amp;#39;s going in my sandwiches for tomorrow&amp;#39;s packed lunch!&amp;#34; - Hayley&#34;&gt;

	&lt;/p&gt;
  


The Brownies arrived, punnets and empty jars in hand, and we cracked on. After the fun of crushing and sieving the strawberries, the girls were supervised as they came to the boil. Adding sugar and some water, we sat and waited while the fruits of our labour were revealed to us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And fruity it was! No fewer than 15 jars of jam were collected from the Brownie fridge on this Friday afternoon, and each more tempting as the last.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Tower of Love</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On 1st February, calm took over the centre as 1st Chilwell Brownies took to their tables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In teams of four, the packets of Love Hearts were opened, decanted into bowls, and tower-making began.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concentration on each of their faces was rich as the clock ticked by; each group fearing the worst - a collapse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No such disaster occurred, as each group built a successful tower of love hearts to show off at the end of the session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best part was that, at the end, we could take it all apart and eat it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
