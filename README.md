# Beeston Girl Guiding

Static site for Beeston Girl Guiding Divisions.
To replace website currently at: beestongirlguiding.org.uk, constructed with BT Community Web Kit.

## How?
New website to be made with Hugo Static Site Generator, and hosted on GitHub.
This allows for version control as well as a discussion platform for development, questions and changes.

## Publishing
Using static pages means that all content pages are written in [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet  "Markdown Cheatsheet") (including this one), and a simple readup of the Markdown syntax gets you ready to write and edit content. Most things are written in plaintext.
A user-friendly publishing system (that makes GitHub the backend, rather than having to go through commits and pull requests) for blog posts and the like is on its way.
