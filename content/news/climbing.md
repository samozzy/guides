On 4th July, 10 of our Rainbows visited the Depot climbing center in Nottingham City Centre. After a short tram journey, we arrived at the center and found our shoes.

Our instructor helped us do some warm-up activities and games before we took to the wall after a short safety demonstration.

All of our Rainbows had a great time, and I think we've got some junior climbers in our midst! There was even a chance for our Leaders to take a climb.

We finished with our instructor playing some warm-down games, which everyone found to be a very enjoyable end of a fabulous evening out.
