On 1st February, calm took over the centre as 1st Chilwell Brownies took to their tables.

In teams of four, the packets of Love Hearts were opened, decanted into bowls, and tower-making began.

The concentration on each of their faces was rich as the clock ticked by; each group fearing the worst - a collapse.

No such disaster occurred, as each group built a successful tower of love hearts to show off at the end of the session.

> The best part was that, at the end, we could take it all apart and eat it!
