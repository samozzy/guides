It was the 27th May, the strawberries were ripening on their branches, and the jars were ready. All signs pointing to a fun afternoon of jam-making!

The Brownies arrived, punnets and empty jars in hand, and we cracked on. After the fun of crushing and sieving the strawberries, the girls were supervised as they came to the boil. Adding sugar and some water, we sat and waited while the fruits of our labour were revealed to us.

And fruity it was! No fewer than 15 jars of jam were collected from the Brownie fridge on this Friday afternoon, and each more tempting as the last.
