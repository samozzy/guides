# Rainbows

{{< pull "Rainbows have fun!" center >}}{{< /pull >}}
They play games, have parties, make things and enjoy the outdoors while developing life skills.

They follow a programme called the **Rainbow Jigsaw**, which involves a wide range of activities and games. Being a Rainbow is all about learning, developing self-confidence, building friendships and, of course, having lots of fun!

The Rainbow Jigsaw has four areas: *Look, Learn, Laugh, Love*

What do girls say about Rainbows?

> "We play games, we celebrate things, we write in our books, we play on the computer, we do painting…" <small>Fareeha, 6</small>

> "We're a little bit the same and a little bit different to other girls. I think Rainbows learn more things. I think it's easier than at school because there are no boys." <small>Isha, 6</small>

> "The best bit was the party for my Promise because we all ate chocolate cake!" <small>Louise, 5</small>

# Brownies

{{< /pull >}}

Their meetings are full of challenges, games and activities, usually ones that the Brownies have suggested themselves. Brownies are girls aged 7 to 10.

Brownies follow a programme called the **Brownie Adventure**. The name reflects the world of exciting opportunities, challenges and fun that is Brownies.

Girls can participate in a wide range of activities at their regular meetings, and at special events, day trips, sleepovers, camps and holidays. They can find themselves trying out arts and crafts or recipes, playing energetic games, taking part in community action projects, or zooming down zip wires at one of our activity centres.

Girls can also extend their knowledge and abilities by working towards Brownies interest badges covering many different hobbies and activities from Science Investigator to Circus Skills.
The Brownie Adventure is divided into three areas: *You, Community, World*.


> "We ate apples and honey, which actually tasted really nice!" <small>Sana, 8</small>
> "I'm doing my Out and about and Science investigator badges – I'm learning to use maps and I'm doing lots of cool science investigations. I want to do my Water sports badge next." <small>Chloe, 9</small>
> "It feels nice to be part of a group of girls who help each other and are friendly. It makes me feel special. I'd hate there to be boys at Brownies!" <small>Heather, 10</small>

# Guides
{{< pull "Guides go for it!" center >}}
{{< /pull >}}

Being a Guide encourages girls to develop by undertaking challenges and pushing the boundaries of their experience. Guides are girls aged 10 to 14.

Members take part in a wide range of exciting activities at their regular meetings, and at special events or holidays. 

Girls do everything from adventure sports to playing fun games, and from taking part in community action projects to the performing arts.

Guides work together in small groups or 'Patrols' and, with the support of an adult Leader, choose and run some of the activities themselves using *Go for It!* resource packs.

Girls can extend their knowledge and skills by working towards Guide interest badges covering many different hobbies and activities from Film lover to Independent living. They can also gain Challenge badges that recognise their participation in Girlguiding over a period of time. The badges build towards the Baden-Powell Challenge Award, named in honour of the founder of Girlguiding.

> "Guiding lets girls think, learn and develop without having to put up with boys trying to be the centre of attention all the time!" <small>Philippa, 16</small>
> "I've had amazing experiences no other organisation can offer.  And we really do get to have our say in stuff that matters." <small>Lucy, 23</small>

# Senior Section

The Senior Section is for young women aged 14 to 25. It offers an exciting and flexible programme with a huge variety of challenges and opportunities for personal development – sure to impress universities and potential employers!

The Look Wider programme offers a range of activities and challenges and motivates members to try out new things – it could be learning a language, playing a musical instrument, running a marathon, camping in the wilds or volunteering overseas. It is flexible and participants can take their chosen activities as far as they wish, from taster level all the way to gaining a qualification that is recognised outside Girlguiding.

Senior Section members can undertake a wide range of awards and qualifications. These include: the Young Leader qualification, which allows them to aid in the running of units for younger girls; the internationally-recognised Duke of Edinburgh's Award Scheme; and other prestigious awards unique to Girlguiding.

There are multiple other activities open to Senior Section members. They can do anything from speaking to younger units about current issues as a peer educator, to changing the future of Girlguiding at an Innovate meeting, to volunteering on an international community project.
