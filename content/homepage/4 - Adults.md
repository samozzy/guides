## Adults

Girlguiding isn't just for girls - within Beeston and Chilwell Division, there are over 160 adult volunteers. Many amazing volunteers contribute time to guiding every year. In return, we offer training and the opportunity to develop new skills.

There are many volunteer roles in guiding. Many volunteers give their time as Leaders or Assistant Leaders for guiding units and get to see girls enjoying events and activities that they have organised. Other volunteers take on administrative responsibilities, or help out with driving or maintenance on an occasional basis.
