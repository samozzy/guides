## Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme
The D of E programme is a real adventure from beginning to end. It doesn't matter who you are or where you're from. You just need to be aged between 14 and 24 and realise there is more to life than sitting on a sofa watching life pass you by! You can do the programme at 3 levels which, when completed, lead to a Bronze, Silver or Gold Duke of Edinburgh Award.

The Duke of Edinburgh Award is hugely popular and prestigious. It can also help you when writing those college or university applications. Nottinghamshire Girlguiding is providing three navigation skill training days for expeditions, of which two out of three must be attended, a camp skills weekend and then a practice and final expedition for the Bronze Award. Silver and Gold expeditions can be arranged if needed. Check out Girlguiding Nottinghamshire Website for more information.
