# Adults

Girlguiding UK isn't just for girls. In Beeston and Chilwell Division, we have around 160 adult volunteers. 

Whatever level of commitment you can make - from ocassional 'behind-the-scenes' support, to planning and leading activities every week - we'd love to have you on the team. In return for your time, we offer training and the opportunity to develop new skills.


There are many volunteer roles in guiding. Many volunteers give their time as Leaders or Assistant Leaders for guiding units and get to see girls enjoying events and activities that they have organised. Other volunteers take on administrative responsibilities, or help out with driving or maintenance on an occasional basis.

Could you help girls and young women to develop their potential? Girlguiding values all its leaders and helpers - and the girls do too! This is hardly surprising when you consider what our volunteers get up to. 


We have a whole range of roles available to suit you no matter how much time or what skills you can offer. Flexible volunteering makes it easy for people to share skills, time and energy in a way that suits their lifestyle. 

These roles can include:

### What's in it for you?
As a volunteer with Girlguiding, you'll make new friends, have a good time and make a real difference to the lives of today's girls and young women. You will also develop skills that will look great on your CV, including leadership, team working and communication. 

As well as broadening the horizons of girls and young women aged between 5 years and 25 years old it also gives you a chance to broaden your own horizons.

### What are we looking for?
Enthusiasm, common sense and a friendly approach are all that’s needed really. As a volunteer you will get a great sense of satisfaction from watching the girls and young women develop their confidence and skills, as well as have lots of fun.

Training and support is given to new volunteers as they work within their Unit. DBS checks will be necessary. This is paid for by Girlguiding. We are happy to explore ways of flexible volunteering. 

As a volunteer you’ll also gain from the experience by making new friends and learning new skills such as leadership and organisational abilities that you can use at work or put on a CV. 

Volunteers make Guiding happen! Be part of it.

Many Guild activities result in positive benefit to the community, but as any Guild member will tell you, a large part of the programme is devoted to having plain old-fashioned fun!

As a Division we are very fortunate to have an active Trefoil Guild to support us.
