<!-- AN EXPLANATION OF THE ABOVE 
Everything between the +++'s is the metadata for this page/post.

- author = [] #Add your name. Default (when the square brackets are empty) is "Beeston HQ"
- categories = ["Uncategorized"] #One way of sorting posts is to categorise them.
- date = YYYYMMDDTHH:MM:SS+GMT #Hugo adds in a date when you make a new page. Change or not. Your call.
- description = "" #Self-explanatory
- draft = true #Set to false to publish the post/page. No quotes around true/false.
- image = "/img/about-bg.jpg" #Add a header image. Maybe. Your call. Put the path to the image here. Usually a kitty by default.
- tags = [] #Another way is to tag them. Do not remove the tag line or things go very badly.
- title = "" #If left blank, the title will be the filename. Recommend filling this in.
